 ### Adult Incoming Prediction Project
 
 In this project, we will predict whether a person makes over $50K a year according to an adult data set which was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. For this dataset, there are fourteen attributes including age, work class, level of education, the total year of being educated, martial status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week and native country.
